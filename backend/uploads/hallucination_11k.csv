"q: answer the question below:   john was watching the movement of a stream in the forest. he noticed that the faster moving stream could carry particles that are larger or smaller?    assuming that:  in erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. a: in the scenario where john is observing a stream, he would notice that a faster-moving stream can carry **larger particles**. this is because, as the water moves more quickly, it has greater energy and force, allowing it to lift and transport heavier materials. 

in contrast, a slower-moving stream typically has less energy and can only carry smaller particles, as they are lighter and easier to move. so, in summary, the faster the stream flows, the larger the particles it can carry!",1.0
"q:  you are an ai assistant. you will be given a task. you must generate a detailed and long answer.  suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: brad (vince vaughn) and kate (reese witherspoon) are an upscale san francisco couple. having both come from dysfunctional families, with divorced parents and siblings with out-of-control kids, the two disdain the idea of getting married or having kids. in an effort to avoid their families at christmas, the two go on vacation abroad while pretending to be doing charity work there. the third christmas of their relationship, brad and kate are trapped at san francisco international airport by a fog bank that cancels every outbound flight, and interviewed by a news crew, alerting their families to the fact they're stuck at home for the holidays. with no way to get out of it, kate and brad find themselves visiting their families on christmas day. they first visit brad's father (robert duvall), then kate's mother (mary steenburgen), then brad's mother (sissy spacek) and, finally, kate's father (jon voight), thereby celebrating four christmases in one day. as they brace themselves for a marathon of homecomings, brad and kate expect the worst, but are nevertheless unable to prepare themselves enough for what they get. as the day progresses, each discover a new secret about their partner that they had previously been too embarrassed to share, namely that brad's real name is 'orlando', and kate has a fear of inflatable castles, stemming from being ostracized as a child, and these discoveries put an intense strain on their relationship. while brad counts down the minutes to freedom, kate finds herself looking at the lives of brad's and her own siblings and comes to realize that she does want a marriage and children of her own, the prospect of which frightens brad when she mentions it to him. eventually, in the final visit of the day, at kate's father's house, kate asks brad to let her spend the visit on her own and claims to her family that they had split up. meanwhile, brad spends some time at his own father's house with just his father and realises that he wants a marriage and children, and that he loves kate way too... a: a fitting title for the movie could be **""four christmases.""**

### reasons for the title:

1. **theme**: it reflects the central plot of brad and kate celebrating four different christmas gatherings in one day.
2. **character growth**: it highlights their journey as they confront family issues and their own relationship desires.
3. **humor and chaos**: it conveys the comedic and chaotic nature of holiday family gatherings.

"q: context: aubrey challenged tracy's friends to a game of hide and seek for an hour.  question: how would aubrey feel afterwards?  which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  a: lazy  b: passive  c: sneaky a: based on the context where aubrey challenged tracy's friends to a game of hide and seek, the best answer would be c: sneaky.

explanation:
sneaky: in a game of hide and seek, players often try to be clever and tricky to find good hiding spots or to sneak up on others. aubrey, by initiating the game, might feel a sense of excitement or sneakiness as they participate in the playful challenge.
the other options don't quite fit:

lazy: this wouldn’t make sense because playing a game requires energy and activity.
passive: this suggests a lack of involvement or action, which is the opposite of what aubrey is doing by challenging others to play.
so, ""sneaky"" is the best choice!

here are some classic car games:

license plate game: you look for license plates from different states and mark them off on a map. the person who finds the most wins!

alphabet signs game: you try to spot all the letters of the alphabet on signs, starting from a to z. the first to find all the letters wins!

        the answer to the question: what is the title of the painting that was referred to in the earliest inventories as la familia? is inside the article: the painting was referred to in the earliest inventories as la familia ('the family'). a detailed description of las meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by antonio palomino ('the giorgio vasari of the spanish golden age') in 1724. examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. for example, at first velã¡zquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.the painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. it was damaged in the fire that destroyed the alcã¡zar in 1734, and was restored by court painter juan garcã­a de miranda (1677â€“1749). the left cheek of the infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. after its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747â€“48, and the infanta was misidentified as maria theresa, margaret theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new madrid royal palace in 1772. a 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, the family of philip iv, which was repeated in the  records of 1814. the painting entered the collection of the museo del prado on its foundation in 1819. in 1843, the prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as las meninas.in recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. it was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the american conservator john brealey, to remove a 'yellow veil' of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century. the cleaning provoked, according to the art historian federico zeri, 'furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different'. however, in the opinion of lã³pez-rey, the..., can you guess it ?

context:

the pearls of the crown (french: 'les perles de la couronne' ) is a 1937 french comedy film of historically-based fiction by sacha guitry who plays four roles in it (many of the other performers play multiple roles, as well). guitry's jean martin investigates the history of seven pearls, four of which end up on the crown of england, while the other three initially go missing.

hypothesis: the subject matter of the movie is the missing crown of england a: the hypothesis can't be drawn from the context. the film focuses on seven pearls, their history, and their connection to the crown of england, but not solely on the crown itself. thus, the subject matter isn't just about the missing crown.",-7.0

        a baker bought cooking ingredients in the supermarket. she bought 3 boxes of flour that cost $3 each box, 3 trays of eggs that cost $10 for each tray, 7 liters of milk that cost $5 each liter, and 2 boxes of baking soda that cost $3 each box. how much will she have to pay for everything?
thoughts? step-by-step reasoning: a: to find out how much the baker will pay for all the ingredients, we can calculate the total cost for each type of item she bought and then add them together.

1. **flour**: she bought 3 boxes, each costing $3.
   - total cost for flour = 3 boxes × $3/box = $9

2. **eggs**: she bought 3 trays, each costing $10.
   - total cost for eggs = 3 trays × $10/tray = $30

3. **milk**: she bought 7 liters, each costing $5.
   - total cost for milk = 7 liters × $5/liter = $35

4. **baking soda**: she bought 2 boxes, each costing $3.
   - total cost for baking soda = 2 boxes × $3/box = $6

now, we add all these totals together:
- total cost = cost of flour + cost of eggs + cost of milk + cost of baking soda
- total cost = $9 + $30 + $35 + $6

now, calculating that:
- $9 + $30 = $39
- $39 + $35 = $74
- $74 + $6 = $80

therefore, the baker will have to pay **$80** for everything.",-7.0

        i am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. can you help me answer a few questions? if you can't, please say 'no i can't'.  question: what is crawford montazano known as? movie title: mad max movie plot: the film is set in the near future of a bleak, dystopian and impoverished australia that is facing a breakdown of civil order primarily due to widespread oil shortages. (this is not explained in this film but in the sequel, mad max 2: the road warrior.) central to the plot is a poorly-funded national police unit called the main force patrol (mfp, derogatorily called 'the bronze' by their enemies), which struggles to protect the outback's few remaining townspeople from violent motorcycle gangs. the mfp's 'top pursuit man' is a young police officer, max rockatansky (mel gibson), badge number mfp4073.a member of one of the motorcycle gangs, crawford montazano (nicknamed nightrider), escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. mfp officers chase the nightrider in a high-speed chase that results in several serious wrecks. among those involved is a cocky motorcycle cop nicknamed goose (steve bisley), who radios max. max pursues nightrider in a high-speed chase which results in nightrider's death in a fiery crash. after the dangerous chase, max' police chief, fifi mcafee, warns max that nightrider's gang will be out for him now because of nightrider's death.nightrider's gang, which is led by toecutter (hugh keays-byrne), plans to avenge nightrider's death by killing mfp officers. meanwhile, they vandalize property, steal fuel, and terrorize the citizenry. while chewing up a town where the nightrider's remains arrived by train, the gang brutalizes a civilian couple that tried escaping to the road; the couple is overtaken, then both of them are raped and the car is wrecked. max and goose are informed about the incident and go to the crime scene. they find toecutter's young protegã©, johnny the boy (tim burns), and the girl of the couple in the middle of the wreckage. johnny's drug-fueled rantings reveal him as a member of nightrider's gang; goose looks on johnny with particular disdain, as his leg was broken during the nightrider pursuit. however, they do not kill johnny, but arrest him...
answer: a: crawford montazano is known as ""nightrider"" in the film ""mad max."" he is a member of a motorcycle gang who escapes police custody, leading to a high-speed chase with max rockatansky. his actions trigger a violent confrontation between the gang and the police, significantly impacting the film's plot. 

the film is set in a dystopian future australia, highlighting themes of lawlessness and the struggle for survival amidst societal breakdown. nightrider's character serves as a catalyst for the events that unfold, demonstrating the chaos and danger that max faces as part of the main force patrol (mfp). this context enhances the film's portrayal of a harsh and unforgiving world.",-1.0

 a: the chicxulub crater was discovered in the late 1970s by geophysicists antonio camargo and glen penfield, who were searching for petroleum in the yucatán peninsula. although penfield initially struggled to confirm it as a crater, he later obtained evidence in 1990 that indicated its impact origin.",-7.0

1. **identify the operation:** the question asks for the sum of two numbers, 3 and 5.
2. **perform the addition:** start by adding the two numbers together: 
   - 3 + 5 = 8.
3. **check the calculation:** confirm the addition by counting: if you start at 3 and count up five steps (4, 5, 6, 7, 8), you arrive at 8.
4. **conclude the answer:** since the calculation is accurate, the answer to the question is 8.

so, the answer is justified as 8.",-7.0

motley crue bassist nikki sixx, who became friends with dio while touring europe, said the rocker will be missed. 

'i still have this image of him standing on stage in front of 100,000 belting out 'man on the silver mountain' and remember the shivers it sent up my spine,' sixx said.

becoming a rock singer requires more vocal control than singing karaoke in a bar. you need to learn how to control the pitch and tone of your voice.  sing from the stomach instead of the throat. singing from the throat is like a speaker without a box. you donâ´t get the fullness of the sound. it will sound squeaky when you try to hit some good notes, especially the high ones. so, mainly use the throat as a conduit. work on hitting high notes.  diaphragm pressure is the key to creating the heavier vocals used by rock singers. your diaphragm controls the air that goes through your vocal chords. some pressure in your diaphragm can push just enough air through your vocal chords to get that heavy grit out. practice changing the pitch. experiment with opening and closing your throat, lips, and teeth to see how much control you have over the sound. closing your throat can add harshness or grit, while opening it can increase volume and improve timbre. lips and teeth affect not only the character (what phonics you make) but also how the vibration of your vocal chords is translated into the air around you. as you become more controlled and proficient in using your voice, try to expand your musical vocabulary by learning about the basics of music and singing.  vocal warm-ups, scales, intervals, and timbre are all helpful things to familiarize yourself with but remember the first rule of rock: do it your way. choose your style of rock. abandon musical lyricism, tone, and articulation. rock singing should be rather ambiguous in rhythm, lyrics, and pitch. that is the essence of hard rock. don't try to learn from a cd or machine. get a great teacher. many professional rock singers have done so. a voice coach will help you develop your voice and can give you tips in how to protect your voice.  rock has a vast array of voice styles and methods. an experienced coach can appropriately assess your improvement. a coach will help you improve your vocal range. there are no shortcuts. it takes a long time to learn to sing well. you might have natural talent, but that will take you only so far. you have to have a solid technique to have a stable career. that is why there are so many 'flash in the pan' performers. they have no technique, and their voices crash and burn quickly. you do have to be able to hold enough breath to push a note loud enough for a microphone or audience to hear it.  focusing on core exercises such as abdominal, chest, and back muscles will help you tighten your core in order to focus on your breath. cardio exercise such as biking, jogging, jump rope, and even brisk walking can improve the amount of breath you have for holding notes and can also help a lot if you're an active singer who does a lot of jumping around or headbanging while singing. take care of your voice. while some singers can smoke and drink and sound like rock stars, that approach might not work for you. it's important to know the limitations of your own voice because nothing is worse than running your voice ragged before your band finishes its first set. everybody has a different vocal range, but most male singers fall into the categories of either bass, baritone or tenor, while most females have either a contralto, mezzo soprano or soprano vocal range.  some people have ranges that extend further than these categories. learning your vocal range is very important because you need to know your limits. learn how to scream. develop a screaming-yelling style to your singing voice. most rock singers do not utilize the same technique as pop stars do: instead of smooth transitions and mild sounds, they go for the more scream-like voice, making it sound more passionate. try yelling parts of any rock lyrics without utilizing vocal notes and then replicating that feeling while singing. a: to become a successful rock singer, one must master vocal control, using techniques like diaphragm pressure and breath support, while embracing personal style and seeking guidance from a coach to develop a solid technique and vocal range.",-3.0

by jennifer newton the site of the world's worst ever nuclear disaster has still not be cleared 28 years on as these bleak pictures show. the photographs were taken by sales manager and photographer toby batchelor who travelled to the nuclear site at pripyat, chernobyl. the 34-year-old of derby spent two days in the city where a nuclear reactor at chernobyl power station exploded on april 26, 1986. during the accident itself, 31 people died and it has left devastating long term effects, such as cancer and deformities, which are still being accounted for. mr batchelor said: 'each day when leaving the area you had to be scanned for high levels of radioactivity.

gas masks are left strewn across the floor inside one of the classrooms in the school in a: pripyat, a haunting reminder of the lives once lived there. desks are covered in dust, and children's drawings hang faded on the walls, telling stories of innocence lost. the silence is palpable, interrupted only by the rustling of debris and the occasional echo of footsteps. mr. batchelor noted, “it feels like time has stopped, frozen in the moment of tragedy.” the eerie stillness underscores the profound impact of the disaster, leaving a ghostly imprint on the landscape and its history.",-3.0

        i love going to the spa. honestly, who doesn't. these days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. i blame the damn kids for that one! so, as you can imagine, i was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an urban spa voucher for the urban indulgence package: one hour hot stone lomi lomi massage followed by a heavenly spa facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for christmas. i had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so i wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  turns out that it is an actual massage. i requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. carrying 15kgs of crazy kid or 9kgs of kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. my therapist (the lovely kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. it was quite a unique experience as one minute i could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next i'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. it really was a delightful sensory experience. as my back was a problem area, kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. i could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. one really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). question: who ate the cake? options: - not enough information   - ffredd   - john   - johns wife === the correct answer is

1. **paper composition**: paper is made from cellulose fibers, which are flammable.
   
2. **fire exposure**: when paper is exposed to fire, the heat causes the fibers to break down.

        what is the last name of the person who told another band member never to talk into the microphone again?  answer the above question based on the context below:  with the addition of stirratt, coomer, and johnston just prior to the recording of anodyne, farrar and tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. in one account, tweedy recalled: around this time, i would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [farrar would] pull me aside and say, 'don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.' he would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like i didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but farrar felt disdain for tweedy's new carefree attitude. years later, farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing tweedy stroking the hair of farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. in january 1994, farrar called manager tony margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. farrar told margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with tweedy anymore. soon after the breakup, farrar explained his departure: 'it just seemed like it reached a point where jeff and i really weren't compatible. it had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.'tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from margherita, since farrar decided not to tell him in person. the following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. as a favor to margheritaâ€”who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band runningâ€”farrar agreed to a final tour with uncle tupelo in north america. tweedy and farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of tweedy's songs. the band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on late night with conan o'brien. sire had requested that the band perform 'the long cut' on the...

        the sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between vancouver and seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. just south of vancouver, in the quaint historic fishing village of steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. the regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the state line from vancouver, back down to the waters of washington state. the shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the nhs. forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from vancouver. not having much success closer to the british columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the canadian/american border. incredibly, the resident killer whales of the san juan islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. much of what is known about the orca whaleâ€™s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the san juan islands of washington. what land mass are the killer whales nearest? - not enough information - san juan islands - fishing village of steveston - vancouver

holly gent palmo and vincent palmo jr. adapted the film's screenplay from robert kaplow's novel of the same name about a teenager (in reality, the 15-year-old arthur anderson, who played lucius in welles' production) involved in the founding of orson welles' mercury theatre. after receiving funding from cinemanx, a production company backed by the isle of man film fund, and an offer from framestore features to co-finance the film, richard linklater came on board to direct me and orson welles. zac efron signed on as the lead in early january 2008, claiming he decided to take the role of richard samuels because 'it's a completely different project than i've ever done before,' while claire danes joined the cast as the protagonist's love interest sonja jones in late january.  in the theatre, christian mckay had portrayed orson welles in the one-man play rosebud: the lives of orson welles at a number of venues, including the edinburgh festival and king's head (london). he reprised the role in the u.s. at the 2007 'brits off broadway' festival, where linklater saw his performance and then cast mckay as welles, retaining him over the subsequent objections of the project's producer.  me and orson welles underwent filming in the isle of man, pinewood studios, london and new york from february to april 2008. filming in london commenced first in mid-february, before scenes in the isle of man were shot february 24-march 14, 2008, where filming locations included gaiety theatre and various other parts of douglas. during filming in douglas, efron and danes believe they sighted a ghost, or 'supernatural' being, outside a window on set at gaiety theatre.  filming in britain resumed in late march for six weeks at pinewood studios. other locations included crystal palace park, where a facade of new york's mercury theatre was set up for a scene. actor james tupper claimed that the best replica of an old new york theater was in england, while many of the actors who filled the company were from the royal shakespeare company. the production crew only briefly visited new york; photographs were taken and footage shot to be added into the film as digital effects. every exterior shot was filmed on a single street built at pinewood studios with a green screen at one end; different angles and slightly altered set designs were used between shots to make the street appear different each time. answer this question using a quote from the following article:

who's dea was it to make the film? a: the idea to make the film ""me and orson welles"" came from richard linklater, who became involved after receiving funding and a co-financing offer. the article states, ""after receiving funding from cinemanx... richard linklater came on board to direct me and orson welles."" this indicates that linklater played a key role in the film's development.",-4.0

        david jon gilmour,  (born 6 march 1946) is an english guitarist, singer and songwriter best known as a longtime member of the progressive rock band pink floyd. he joined the group as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968, effectively as a replacement for founder member syd barrett, who was dismissed from the band shortly afterwards. pink floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums the dark side of the moon, wish you were here, animals, and the wall. by the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; it was estimated that by 2012 the band had sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million units sold in the united states.

david jon gilmour was born on 6 march 1946 in cambridge, england. his father, douglas gilmour, eventually became a senior lecturer in zoology at the university of cambridge, and his mother, sylvia (nee wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the bbc. at the time of gilmour's birth they lived in trumpington, cambridgeshire, but in 1956, after several relocations, the couple moved their family to grantchester meadows.  gilmour's parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, bill haley's 'rock around the clock'. his enthusiasm for music was stirred the following year by elvis presley's 'heartbreak hotel', and later 'bye bye love' by the everly brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. he then borrowed one from his neighbour, but never gave it back. soon afterward, he started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by pete seeger. at age 11, gilmour began attending the perse school on hills road, cambridge, which he 'didn't enjoy'. while there he met future pink floyd guitarist syd barrett and bass guitarist roger waters, who attended cambridgeshire high school for boys, which was also situated on hills road.  in 1962, gilmour began studying a-level modern languages at cambridge technical college. despite not finishing the course, he eventually learnt to speak fluent french. barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with gilmour. in late 1962, gilmour joined the blues rock band jokers wild. they recorded a one-sided album and a single at regent sound studio, in west london, but only fifty copies of each were made. in august 1965, gilmour busked around spain and france with barrett and some other friends, performing songs by the beatles. they were not very successful, getting arrested on one occasion and living a virtually hand-to-mouth existence, which resulted in gilmour requiring treatment in a hospital for malnutrition. he and barrett later trekked to paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the louvre. during that time gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for fashion designer ossie clark.  gilmour travelled to france in mid-1967 with rick wills and willie wilson, formerly of jokers wild. the trio performed under the band name flowers, then bullitt, but they were not commercially successful. after hearing their uninspired covers of current chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in paris, thieves stole their equipment. while in france, gilmour contributed--as a session musician--lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film two weeks in september, starring brigitte bardot. in may, gilmour briefly returned to london in search of new gear. during his stay, he watched pink floyd record 'see emily play' and was shocked to find that barrett did not seem to recognise him. when bullitt returned to england later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry.

using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: in what year was he at the college a: david gilmour studied at cambridge technical college in 1962. this is noted in the article when it says, ""in 1962, gilmour began studying a-level modern languages at cambridge technical college.""",-3.0

        question. wallace runs a beef jerky company. the company dries the jerky low and slow, so one batch of jerky takes all night to make. each batch can make 10 bags of jerky. wallace received a customer order for 60 bags of jerky. if he has 20 bags of jerky already made, how many days will it be before he can fulfill the customerâ€™s order?
answer. 4
what step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer? a: to determine how many days it will take wallace to fulfill the customer’s order for 60 bags of jerky, follow these steps:

1. **current inventory**: wallace has 20 bags of jerky already made.
2. **order requirement**: the customer ordered 60 bags.
3. **bags needed**: calculate how many more bags wallace needs:  
   \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) bags needed.
4. **batch capacity**: each batch of jerky produces 10 bags.
5. **batches required**: calculate how many batches are needed for 40 bags:  
   \( \frac{40 \text{ bags}}{10 \text{ bags/batch}} = 4 \) batches.
6. **time per batch**: since each batch takes one night to make, wallace will need 4 nights to complete the 4 batches.
7. **days to fulfill order**: therefore, it will take wallace 4 days to fulfill the customer’s order.

this reasoning shows that the answer is justified: wallace will take 4 days to fulfill the order.",-4.0

        summarize this article:

different types of snoring are caused by different things, and you will need to understand the root cause in order to find a solution. to start: ask your partner or your roommate whether you snore with your mouth open or with your mouth closed.  if you snore with your mouth wide open, your throat passage may be partially blocked. when you sleep, the muscles in your throat relax--and sometimes they relax so much that air cannot flow. you gasp for air, and this causes you to snore. a blocked throat passage can be a symptom of various health issues, from sleep apnea to a sinus infection.  closed-mouth snoring indicates that your tongue may be getting in the way of your windpipe, particularly if you are sleeping on your back. if you sleep on your back, buy yourself a few extra pillows and prop yourself up in bed, rather than lying flat on your back. this will help keep your throat unblocked.  consider raising the head of your bed. some mattresses and bed frames are adjustable, allowing you to raise the headrest at the click of a button. if you own an adjustable bed, use it! if you do not own an adjustable bed, you may consider raising the headboard yourself. place a 2x4 plank or a brick underneath each of the two legs at the head of the bed. make sure that the incline is not too steep that you slide out of bed, and make sure that the bed is stable before you try to sleep in it. when you sleep on your back, your tongue may rest against your throat, blocking your windpipe  and causing you to snore. experiment with side- and stomach-sleeping positions, and find what works for you. if you are comfortable, you will be less likely to roll back onto your back in your sleep. when you try to roll onto your back in your sleep, the tennis ball will wake you. gradually, you may be able to train yourself not to sleep on your back. alcohol is a muscle relaxant, and it can relax the muscles that keep your windpipe open, thus blocking your air intake. your body overcompensates for the blockage by taking in too much air, which causes snoring. moreover, alcohol leads to less restful, more disturbed sleep. marijuana, like alcohol, can relax your throat muscles and induce snoring. it also resembles alcohol in that pre-sleep use can prevent sleepers from dipping into restorative rem sleep, leaving them groggy and restless when the morning comes. if you consume cannabis by smoking it, the smoke may also play a factor in your snoring problem. regular smoking can irritate the skin in your nose and throat, which dries out your airways and makes a blockage more likely. sedatives and sleeping pills can cause your throat muscles to relax in the same way as alcohol and cannabis, blocking your windpipe and inducing your body to snore. this, too, can relax your muscles to the point of snoring. extra weight may add excess tissue to your neck. this tissue may constrict your windpipe, leading to the vibrations that we know as snoring. losing weight can grant you many additional health benefits beyond the realm of snoring! regular smoking can irritate the skin in your nose and your throat, which may obstruct your breathing. if you are a heavy smoker with a chronic snoring problem, consider quitting or moderating your habit. smoking can cause obstructions in your windpipe, swelling of the mucous membrane in the nose, swelling of the tissue in the throat, and blockage of the small vessels in the lungs. . we snore when loose throat tissue relaxes and blocks our airway. a regular singing practice may strengthen the throat muscles and firm the tissue of your throat and mouth, making your throat less likely to close up at night.  this may work particularly well for aging snorers whose throat muscles have weakened with time. if you're not into singing, consider trying a few tongue and throat stretches. stick your tongue out as far as you can, then relax. repeat 10 times. stick your tongue out again, and try to touch your chin. hold. repeat, but try to touch your nose instead. repeat 10 times. a: the article explains that different types of snoring stem from various causes. it suggests asking someone if you snore with your mouth open or closed to identify the issue. open-mouth snoring may indicate a blocked throat, possibly due to health issues like sleep apnea. solutions include sleeping on your side, using extra pillows, and avoiding alcohol and sedatives. weight loss can also help, as excess tissue may constrict airflow. additionally, singing or performing throat exercises can strengthen throat muscles, reducing snoring.",-4.0

input: 3, 7, ['4995', 'd', 'l', 'a', '6785', 'i', '3981', '9265', 'e']
output: a: to solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **identify the range:** we're given `i = 3` and `j = 7`, which means we will look at the elements in the list from index 3 to index 7, inclusive.

2. **extract the sublist:** from the list `a = ['4995', 'd', 'l', 'a', '6785', 'i', '3981', '9265', 'e']`, we extract the elements from index 3 to 7. the sublist is `['a', '6785', 'i', '3981', '9265']`.

3. **identify numerical elements:** we need to find which of these elements are numerical. the numerical elements are `6785`, `3981`, and `9265`.

'russian supplied tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers have been insufficient to defeat ukraine' armed forces. so now an increasing number of russian troops are intervening directly in fighting on ukrainian territory. russia has also sent its newest air defense systems including the sa-22 into eastern ukraine,' he wrote. this is the step from proxy war to war. it is also probably the end of german chancellor angela merkel's attempts to prevent the worst through diplomacy. she spoke to russian president vladimir putin more than 30 times this year on the phone, much more often than any other western leader.

germany has taken the lead in the crisis because it has become a central player in a: the european response to russia's aggression. as tensions escalate, germany is likely to push for stronger sanctions against russia and bolster support for ukraine. the eu may unite to impose economic measures aimed at crippling russia’s economy, while nato could enhance its military presence in eastern europe. this situation may lead to a protracted conflict, with diplomatic efforts increasingly overshadowed by military realities on the ground. the future remains uncertain as global powers grapple with this escalating crisis.",-1.0

problem: the length of a rectangular plot is thrice its width . if the area of the rectangular plot is 675 sq meters , then what is the width ( in meters ) of the rectangular plot ? 
options: a ) 12 , b ) 15 , c ) 18 , d ) 21 , e ) 24
a: a: to solve the problem:

1. let the width be \( w \).  
2. then the length is \( 3w \).  
3. the area of the rectangle is given by \( \text{area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 3w \times w = 3w^2 \).

set this equal to the given area:
\[ 3w^2 = 675 \]

your hair doesn't need to be freshly washed for this method, but it should be damp. if you're starting with dry hair, use a spray bottle to dampen your hair. if you decide to wash your hair, let it dry a bit before putting your hair in buns. to get big, messy beyoncã© waves, you need to give your hair some body. whether you use a cream, gel, or spray, be sure to apply a light coat to all of your hair.  if your hair tends to get frizzy, apply a lightweight leave-in conditioner or oil as well. if you plan on blowdrying your hair, apply heat protectant to your hair. how much hair you have will determine how many buns you'll need. if you have thicker hair, you will most likely need 2-3 buns. if you have finer hair, you can get away with 1-2 buns. hold each section in place with a hair tie until it is time to put it in a bun.  the way you divide your hair is completely up to you. for example, you can part your hair down the middle so that you have one bun on each side of your head, or you can  place the top half of your hair in one bun, and the bottom half of your hair in another bun. this method works best on longer hair styles. if you have shorter hair, you may need to add an extra bun or two to ensure that no pieces of hair are left out of a bun. take the first section of your hair out of it's hair tie. twirl your hair and twist it into a bun â€“ think of tight princess leia buns, or the swirl of a cinnamon roll to give you an idea of what these buns should look like. don't worry about the buns looking perfect, but make sure all of your hair is twisted tightly.  secure the bun with a hair tie, a hair clip, or bobby pins. make sure the ends of your hair are tucked into your bun. repeat this process with each section of hair. ideally, you should sleep in your buns overnight to set the waves into your hair. if you're able to sleep in your buns overnight, tie a scarf around your head to prevent your hair from frizzing. if you don't have all night to let your hair dry, it's time to blow dry those buns! to ensure your buns are thoroughly dried, blow dry each bun for at least 10 minutes. (remember, if you plan on blowdrying your hair, use a heat protectant on your hair before you put it in buns). unwrap each bun and gently loosen each twist with your fingers. once you've taken all of your buns down, style your hair. if you like the messy waves, only use your fingers to comb through your hair. if you want a smoother look, brush your hair. finish your beyoncã© look with hairspray.

summary: a: to create big, messy beyoncé waves, start with damp hair (or use a spray bottle if it’s dry). apply a light coat of cream, gel, or spray for body, and use leave-in conditioner for frizz control. depending on your hair thickness, section it into 1-3 buns. twist each section into a bun and secure it. ideally, sleep in the buns overnight or blow-dry for 10 minutes. after removing the buns, style your hair to your preference and finish with hairspray.",-4.0

        seoul â€” the recent u.s. missile strikes against syria could increase pressure on north korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. the united states, france and britain fired 105 missiles at three syrian chemical weapons facilities on saturday, in response to an alleged syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. the syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. the combined military strike on syria comes as the administration of u.s. president donald trump and the government of north korean leader kim jong un are preparing for an expected summit in late may or early june to discuss dismantling the northâ€™s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. trumpâ€™s willingness to use force against syria can be seen to reinforce his â€œmaximum pressureâ€ campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most north korean exports, the u.s. would take military action, if necessary, to force kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the u.s. mainland. calling the u.s. attack on syria â€œa warning for pyongyang,â€ the south korean newspaper the korea joongang daily, in an editorial on monday said, â€œif kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.â€ from this perspective the u.s. show of force in syria will increase pressure on the leadership in north korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the trump-kim summit. â€œunless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the trump administration will not be satisfied,â€ said bong young-shik, a political analyst with the yonsei university institute for north korean studies in seoul however the u.s. military strike on syria could also reinforce concerns in north korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the... who or what will keep the nuclear program if it thinks that its regime is not guaranteed? pick the correct answer from the following options:  a. north korea  b. not enough information  c. president trump  d. syria

3. **detailed answer regarding the u.s. missile strikes**:
   - the missile strikes by the u.s., france, and britain aimed at syrian chemical weapon facilities followed a chemical attack in douma. this action may increase pressure on north korea regarding its nuclear weapons. the u.s. is willing to use military force to push north korea to denuclearize, while the situation could also raise fears in north korea about their security without nuclear deterrence. the correct answer to the question of who will keep the nuclear program is **a. north korea**, because if they feel their regime is not secure, they are likely to maintain their nuclear capabilities.

        q:the rise of multinational corporations  , global marketing, new communications technologies, and shrinking cultural differences have led to an unparalleled increase in global public relations or pr. surprisingly, since modern pr was largely an american invention, america's relations is being threatened by pr efforts in other countries. ten years ago, for example, the world's top five public relations agencies were american-owned. in 1991, only one was. the british in particular are becoming more sophisticated and creative. a recent survey found that more than half of all british companies include pr as part of their corporate   planning activities, compared to about one-third of u.s. companies.it may not be long before london replaces new york as the capital of pr. why is america lagging behind in the global pr race? firstly, americans as a whole tend to be fairly provincial and take more of an interest in local affairs. knowledge of world geography, for example, has never been strong in this country. secondly, americans lag behind their european and asian counterparts   in knowing a second language. less than 5 percent of burson--marshall's u.s.employees know two languages. ogilvy and mather have about the same percentage. conversely, some european firms have half or more of their employees fluent in a second language. finally, people involved in pr abroad tend to keep a closer eye on international affairs. in the financial pr area, for instance, most americans read the wall street journal. overseas, their counterparts read the journal as well as the financial times of london and the economist, publications not often read in this country. perhaps the pr industry might take a lesson from ted turner of cnn (cable news network). turner recently announced that the word 'foreign' would no longer be used on cnn news broadcasts. according to turner, global communications have made the nations of the world so interdependent that there is no longer any such thing as foreign. it could be inferred that the author of the passage is  _  . a) an american b) a briton c) ted turner d) an asian

american apparel ceo fighting 'vigorously' to retake company

image: keith bedford/bloomberg via getty images

dov charney, the embattled american apparel ceo subject to a boardroom coup last week, has filed paperwork with the sec stating he intends to 'vigorously' fight his ouster with the help of some investors.

charney 'was approached by certain persons, including stockholders of the issuer, who expressed support for his continued leadership,' the filing states. the schedule 13 d filing, the form that is often the precursor to a hostile takeover or another change of ownership, doesn't name the investors. the new york post reports that one is fivet capital, a switzerland investment firm with a 13% stake in the company.

investor lion capital also told the board it planned to exercise its right to add two seats of its own to the company's board, according to the post. it's unclear whether lion supports charney.

on friday, the post reported that charney was 'angling to gain a voting majority by packing the seven-member board with additional seats.'

american apparel reps could not be reached for comment.

american apparel's board met for 10 hours last wednesday and decided to oust the ceo and founder due to an 'ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct.' under charney's contract, he has 30 days to 'resolve the conflict' with the board before he can be fired; that would give him until july 18.

the board didn't go into details, but buzzfeed obtained a copy of its termination letter over the weekend. news of the letter had leaked on whisper.

among the board's grievances are the allegation that charney refused to participate in mandatory sexual harassment training and used severance packages to quiet former employees.

'in terms of finances, your conduct has required the company to incur significant and unwarranted expenses, including expenses associated with litigation and defense costs, significant settlement payments, substantial severance packages that were granted to employees, and unwarranted business expenses that you incurred for personal reasons,' the board wrote in the letter.

the company has listed five arbitration cases against charney. it has settled two. according to a report in the wall street journal, the company agreed to pay former sales manager mary nelson a $1.3 million settlement. nelson claimed charney made sexual advances before he fired her. the settlement 'later got entangled in a dispute over language in the arbitration that would say mr. charney never made any advances toward her.'

        please answer the following question: read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. context: the sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between vancouver and seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. just south of vancouver, in the quaint historic fishing village of steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. the regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the state line from vancouver, back down to the waters of washington state. the shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the nhs. forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from vancouver. not having much success closer to the british columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the canadian/american border. incredibly, the resident killer whales of the san juan islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. much of what is known about the orca whaleâ€™s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the san juan islands of washington. question: how long has the narrator been going on whale watches? options: - not enough information - the day he got his current job - this is his first - since he rode a seaplane

        read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. context: in this article, iâ€™ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. this is sometimes referred to as â€œchecking labs,â€ â€œdoing bloodwork,â€ or even â€œchecking blood.â€ most older adults have been through this. for instance, itâ€™s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and itâ€™s part of most emergency room care. such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or â€œcomplete physical.â€ last but not least, blood testing is usually â€” although not always â€” very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. fatigued and experiencing low energy? we should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. confused and delirious? bloodwork can help us check on an older personâ€™s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. but often, itâ€™s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older personâ€™s health care concerns. so as a geriatrician, i routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. but today, itâ€™s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. in fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (and then, keep it in your personal health record!) this way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, youâ€™ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. in this article, iâ€™m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older... question: the author probably believes that: options: - not enough information - they are only recommended to aging adults - laboratory results are accurate - laboratory results are easily understandable without interpretations from medical doctors

i am a single mom of a 10 year old son and his hair grows out so fast. i hate the quality of the cheap hair cut places we all know the names of them. anyway, i wanted my son to have good hair cuts, preferably like military style. being a girl i knew nothing of barber shops really, but i went to beauty brands myself and loved it. next door was a cute little barber shop, very clean and classy looking, so i walked in with my son and even though i a got a little bit of looks for being a girl and walking in to a barber shop, where men usually expect a break from the female species, they were still completely polite and fast. usually within 0-5 min my son was in a seat getting his hair cut. they were professional, great at cutting his hair, and even started remembering us after a few visits. the 15 dollar price for a kids cut was a little more than the cheap places, but not unreasonable at all, and well worth it. each chair had a separate tv to watch and mostly they would change to cartoons for my young son (we've been going since he was about 3). the atmosphere was awesome for a 'man' business, they have a pool table, and games to play while waiting. they do the whole hot towel and straight edge shave for the men, they even did the hot towel and shoulder massage for my son if he wanted. i can't say enough of how great they treated us, how great the hair cut always was, the atmosphere amazing, and price totally reasonable.  honestly i would have left 5 stars, but in the past few years they hired a female to cut hair, and an older gentleman. neither of those two were as good at cutting hair. but still v's is amazing and i love them and never want to go anywhere else. i just request the guy i know is really good and our experience is always awesome! i am constantly telling people to go there....choose from: a. negative. b. positive. i think the answer is a:

(july 2016) (learn how and when to remove this template message) set in 1934 paris, the film opens with richard di nardo, a young hustler, emerging from the bed of gay middle-aged carroll todd (robert preston), aka toddy; richard dresses, takes money from toddy's wallet and leaves toddy's apartment. going about his day, toddy, a performer at chez lui in paris, sees labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, victoria grant (julie andrews). after the audition, labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. that night, richard comes to chez lui as part of a straight foursome and toddy incites a brawl by insulting richard and the women in his group. labisse fires toddy and bans him from the club. walking home, he spots victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. as neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. the duo run out through the rain to toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. the next morning richard shows up to collect his things. victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in toddy's closet. when she thinks that richard might harm toddy, she ambushes richard and literally kicks him out. witnessing this, toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to andre cassell (john rhys-davies), the most successful agent in paris, as a female impersonator. cassell accepts her as count victor grazinski, a gay polish female impersonator and toddy's new boyfriend. cassell gets her a nightclub show and...

        when people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. â€œit is the key to self improvement!â€, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, sadly, many donâ€™t quite practice what they preach. seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. for those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. for those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. hereâ€™s the thing: these are not binary personalities. while some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. as such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. this is a guide with some things i have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. in my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. letâ€™s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who donâ€™t share the same confidence. an understanding of our current limitations is healthy. when we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. the confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: â€œi might suck now, but i am going to learn and get betterâ€. when we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. what is probably true about most people?  a. not enough information  b. most people want to be timid  c. most people want to be criticized  d. most people probably want to be confident
a: a: the best answer to the question ""what is probably true about most people?"" is **d. most people probably want to be confident.**

### explanation:

1. **value of confidence**: the passage emphasizes the importance of confidence in personal and professional growth. it discusses how individuals benefit from being confident enough to embrace feedback and learn from failures. this suggests that a desire for confidence is a common trait among most people.

2. **mixed personalities**: the author points out that most people are not strictly confident or insecure but rather possess a blend of both. this blend indicates that even those who might seem overly confident have their insecurities, and those who feel insecure may also have moments of confidence. thus, the overarching theme is the pursuit of a balance that includes confidence.

3. **impact of feedback and learning**: the discussion about how critical feedback can be hard to accept—especially for those with insecurities—reinforces the idea that confidence is a key factor in handling challenges. the acknowledgment that ""i might suck now, but i am going to learn and get better"" underscores a desire to grow and improve, which is closely tied to confidence.

4. **human nature**: the passage reflects a fundamental aspect of human nature: the aspiration for self-improvement and personal development, which is typically associated with confidence.

in summary, the passage illustrates that most people likely strive for confidence as part of their journey toward self-improvement and effective collaboration. this makes option d the most accurate choice.

milan 0-1 atlã©tico madrid

atlã©tico madrid must have wondered how they escaped back to the vicente calderã³n with an unlikely victory after milan dominated possession without making the vital breakthrough.

diego costa grabbed the only goal seven minutes from time during a rare foray into enemy territory by the visitors but milan will look back on a first half in which they could have been home and dry by the interval.

twice they hit the woodwork, first with kakã¡. adel taarabt teed up the brazilian who unleashed a shot that was heading for the far top corner until thibaut courtois flung himself across goal to tip the ball on to the bar.

in the 18th minute it was the post's turn to intervene. taarabt was involved again, sweeping in a cross which andrea poli met perfectly, glancing his header down to the far bottom corner only for milan to be denied again by the fingertips of courtois, who got just enough on the ball to deflect it on to the post.

atlã©tico were doing their best to disrupt milan's rhythm with a succession of petty fouls, emiliano insãºa seeing yellow for hacking down mattia de sciglio, but on the half-hour kakã¡ was again testing their defence. mario balotelli wrongfooted the visitors with a sly backheel and kakã¡ saw his shot whistle just over the bar.

if anything, atlã©tico stepped up their fouling in the second half, with balotelli their principal target, but milan resolutely wasted every free-kick they were given. balotelli departed after 77 minutes clutching his shoulder after another hefty challenge and was replaced by giampaolo pazzini. the substitution coincided with a spell of increased ambition from atlã©tico, who at last began to get players into the opposition half with some regularity.

they almost scored in the 79th minute when raãºl garcã­a blazed over from around the penalty spot. in the 83rd minute they did make what may be the tie's decisive breakthrough. gabi's corner from the right skimmed off the top of ignazio abate and diego costa crashed his header past the helpless christian abbiati.a a: ### summary:

atlético madrid secured a surprising 1-0 victory over ac milan in a match where milan dominated possession but failed to convert their chances. despite milan's strong performance, highlighted by two shots that hit the woodwork—one from kaká and another from andrea poli—atlético’s goalkeeper thibaut courtois made crucial saves to keep the score level.

throughout the game, atlético disrupted milan's rhythm with persistent fouling, especially targeting mario balotelli, who was eventually substituted after sustaining an injury. as the match progressed, atlético began to assert themselves offensively. the decisive moment came in the 83rd minute when diego costa scored the only goal of the match, heading in from a corner taken by gabi. this late goal allowed atlético to escape with a hard-fought victory, despite milan's earlier dominance.",-4.0

output: a: to complete this task, follow these simple steps:

### task explanation
1. **understanding the task**: you need to translate a given japanese sentence into filipino while ensuring that the meaning remains the same.
2. **guidelines**: 
   - maintain the same meaning throughout the translation.
   - keep any numbers from the original sentence unchanged in the translation.

### steps to find the answer
1. **read the japanese sentence**: carefully analyze the sentence to understand its meaning.
2. **identify key elements**: look for important phrases and any numerical values.
3. **translate phrase by phrase**: start translating the sentence into filipino, focusing on each segment. make sure to capture the essence of the original meaning.
4. **check for accuracy**: once translated, review the sentence to ensure it conveys the same message as the original japanese sentence.
5. **keep numbers unchanged**: if there are any numbers in the original sentence, they should be directly copied into your filipino translation without modification.

### example translation
the original japanese sentence translates roughly to: ""the correction case is related to searching for words in the paragraph, and the submission for this correction is dependent on success or failure.""

### final output
using the guidelines, your filipino translation could be: ""ang kaso ng pagwawasto ay may kinalaman sa paghahanap ng mga salita sa talata, at ang pagsusumite para sa pagwawasto na ito ay nakasalalay sa tagumpay o pagkabigo.""

        please answer the following question: is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. but it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. during my days as an inmate in bridges house at the university of new brunswick, i shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the don and resident fellow. this is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. being rather physically small and odd, i came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called scut, a large and obnoxious newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). i can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that i decided to get my own back. it's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. i think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. and so it was that i laid my plans against scut. the occasion and place were set. my means of entry was secured. now i needed material. for me, the only good fish is a live one. even though i hale from nb, i really don't like free-swimming seafood. considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that i eat anything at all. so with dead, smelly fish in mind, i persuaded my friend shan to pick one up when he was down at the saturday farmer's market. he returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe iron chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard). it took me all day to thaw out the fish in the lounge sink?#8364;?an activity which elicited howls of complaint from the guys trying to watch tv. what did the fish have 'more of than any other fish?' - scales - eyes - bones - not enough information
a: a: the passage revolves around a humorous anecdote from the author's time at the university of new brunswick, where he recounts a conflict with a larger peer named scut. the author reflects on his plan for revenge, which involves using a dead fish. 

to answer the question about what the fish has ""more of than any other fish,"" the correct answer is **bones**. the author specifically mentions that shad has ""even more bones than other fish,"" emphasizing its bony nature, which is likely a part of the humorous context regarding the revenge plan.

so, the fish in question, shad, is noted for having more bones compared to other types of fish, making this the most fitting answer to the question.",-4.0

jimmy norman, singer who worked with marley and hendrix, dies at 74

jimmy norman, a rhythm-and-blues singer and songwriter who worked with bob marley and jimi hendrix early in their careers and was involved in a longstanding dispute over songwriting credit for the song â€œtime is on my side,â€ died on nov. 8 in manhattan. he was 74.

the cause was lung disease, said his daughter missy scott.

mr. norman, whose recording career began in the late 1950s, had minor success as a solo act, with two of his songs reaching the top 40 on billboardâ€™s r&b chart: â€œi donâ€™t love you no more (i donâ€™t care about you)â€ in 1962 and â€œcan you blame meâ€ in 1966. but he found a niche in music history through his encounters with other musicians.

in 1966 hendrix played guitar on at least one of mr. normanâ€™s songs, â€œthat little old groovemaker,â€ and in 1968 a young marley stayed with mr. norman on a visit to new york. more than 30 years later, a cassette tape of marley and mr. norman singing together on that visit was sold at christieâ€™s for $26,290.

but mr. norman is best known for his efforts to gain credit for contributing lyrics to â€œtime is on my side,â€ originally written by jerry ragovoy. in its first recording, by the trombonist kai winding in 1963, the song had only a handful of words. a year later the singer irma thomas recorded a version with a full set of lyrics, and on initial pressings mr. norman, who said he had been hired by a producer to add lyrics, was credited as a co-writer.

ms. thomasâ€™s recording became the basis of the rolling stonesâ€™ hit, which reached the top 10 later in 1964, but by then mr. normanâ€™s name had disappeared from the credits and would never reappear. mr. ragovoy died in july at 80.

mr. norman made many attempts to get credit on â€œtime is on my side,â€ which would have entitled him to substantial royalties. in 1994 the songâ€™s publisher, warner/chappell, acknowledged in a letter that mr. norman had â€œchanged some of the lyricsâ€ to the song but declined to share the copyright with him, saying that his credit on the early pressings had been the result of a clerical error.

james norman scott was born in nashville on aug. 12, 1937, and left home as a teenager to pursue a musical career. in the early â€™70s he was part of the pianist eddie palmieriâ€™s latin jazz group harlem river drive and joined the coasters as a replacement member, a job he held on and off until his health gave way in 1998.

unable to work, he was nearly evicted from his apartment in 2002, when the jazz foundation of america, which helps needy musicians, intervened on his behalf. a group volunteer found the marley tape while cleaning mr. normanâ€™s apartment, said wendy oxenhorn, its executive director.

in 2004 mr. norman recorded an album, â€œlittle pieces,â€ released by judy collinsâ€™s label, wildflower, and two years ago he released another album, â€œthe way i see it.â€

besides his daughter missy scott, he is survived by a son, james scott; another daughter, madge wells; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

summary: a: jimmy norman, a rhythm-and-blues singer and songwriter known for his collaborations with bob marley and jimi hendrix, passed away at 74 due to lung disease. norman had minor chart success but is best remembered for his longstanding dispute over songwriting credit for ""time is on my side."" born in nashville in 1937, he struggled for recognition despite his contributions, including writing lyrics for the song. he is survived by his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.",-3.0
